Project Idea Title 1: Deep Learning on a public dataset  
**Kaori Murakami**  

Both the Jupyter notebook and the html version of it are included in this repository.

### Dataset
Due to the size of the dataset (over 50,000 images) please download it directly from Kaggle
Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species

### Model files
Due to space constraints, I am only including the .h5 files of the models from scratch, EfficientNet with fine tuning and data augmentation, and Inception with fine tuning.

Including all h5 files had a total size of 36.7 GB.
The h5 files can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EdEx4S8zcQYRlDzDUgcHLS8kDCE2YRUC?usp=sharing
